The simulated data were created to have a number of variables (4) that we wish to post-stratify on. To complexity of the description, we name these variables after common variables that people often wish to post-stratify on; gender, age group, ethnicity and income level. These variables are rarely independent, so we included an interaction between gender and age.

We also created the data set so that it has a clustered design, with individuals clustered into different cities, which were also clustered in different states. This reflects common sampling schemes in survey based research.

The data were created in the script ``Simulate the data.Rdata''. In the rest of this appendix we will summarise the steps for the creating this data to allow the reader to find the script more accessible. Each section in the script is separated so that it corresponds to a paragraph in this section. 

The first stage of the creation was to produce a post-stratification dataframe such that each row represents a unique combination post-stratification levels. We use four post stratification variables with levels ranging from two to five (2, 4, 5, 5). We also included variables that represented states (5 levels) and cities (9 levels). A full set of all possible combinations is $9,000$. 

The next stage is to fill the proportion and then the number of people in the population that are in each combination. As this is a clustered design, many of the combinations will have no proportion of the population in it. Cities can only belong to one state, so if the individual is in one of the other states, the proportion of individuals in cities that are not in the state will be, by default, zero. The matrix of non-zero proportions is $1,800$. Once we have the proportion of people in each cell, we multiply by the number of people in the population to obtain the number of people in each sub-category. This forms our post-stratification matrix, which is representative of the \textit{population}.

From this we need to create our \textit{sample} data. The whole point of this analysis is that the sample is \textbf{not} representative of the population but instead has some sort of bias in the probability of obtaining a response from participants. This could be due to sampling bias or response bias or some other factor provided that the reason for bias in the sample does not result in under-sampling of people that are directly related to the outcome variable that we would like to estimate. For example, if preference for cats means that you never participate in surveys, then the survey would have a biased estimate that could not be mitigated by post-stratification.

The outcome of the previous step is the proportion of people who will respond to the survey given their subcategory. Given the size of the survey (in this data set $5,000$), we randomly sample from the subcategories according to the proportion.

At this stage we have a set of people in each proportion who belong to the different sub-categories of our post-stratification variables. Next we create a set of vectors that represent the preference for cats given each level of each subcategory, as well as a matrix that represents the interaction in preference for cats between age and gender. 

Lastly we have all of the necessary ingredients to create a dataframe where each row represents a fictional participant in the study, their different post-stratification variable membership and whether they said they preferred cats or not. 

To demonstrate the efficacy of this model at estimating the proportion of cat preference in the population, we use the nature of simulation to calculate the true preference from cats in the population.
